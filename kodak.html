<h2> Kodak Experience Design  </h2>


<p>

  &nbsp; Kodak Annex is a conceptual tablet application that was designed in homage to Kodak's historical mark as a brand. Intended for film enthusiasts to reconnect with the unique analogue experience that Kodak created, the tangibility of the tablet feature designs offers an adaption to evolved technology that re-highlights the heart of Kodak: Analogue.

</p>

<p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>


<p>
  &nbsp; The challange of Kodak's business problem was to rebuild a demand for film again in a withering analogue world.
  We recognized the core heart of Kodak's brand in analog and wanted to acknowledge the niche market
  of independent filmmakers/film enthusiasts that we could build new and enticing experiences for.
</p>

<h2> Limitations </h2>

     <p>&nbsp; Addressing the high price range  in making film into a hobby was one of the main issues we wanted to ovecome by allowing users to shop by a budget.
     However due time constraints, we chose to have quality over the quantity of features and decided to omit this in our final design. Although
      we couldn't complete a budgeting filter as one of desired touchpoint feature, I learned that our work flow efficiency could of have been better improved
      by stricter deadines. I also learned that we could of made better key decisions throughout the process of our design iterations rather than prolonging redundant group ideation. </p>

<h2> Solution </h2>

    <p> &nbsp; Our final design featured three main ideas: direct interactions in learning how to use a film camera, inspirational content, and an educational showcase on the variety of aesthetic films. Overall, we created a digital platform designed for film enthusiasts
    to learn more about film and promoted it in way that aimed to entice interest and encouraged the ease of use. </p>

<h2> My Role </h2>

    <p> &nbsp; In this project my roles included: leading team on tight schedules, ideating the business pitch, copywritting, and the making of visual graphics/presentation slides.<br> </p>
