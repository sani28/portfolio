<h2> Code Drillz Website </h2>

  &nbsp; Completed in a 48 hour design challenge at CodeCore's 2017 Summer Bootcamp, this application was designed for users to practice coding drill questions and compete with one another.
  Admins can create new drills and assign points to each question. Questions are unique and are validated in the back end.
  Built with Ruby on Rails, postgreSQL, Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery and HTML. Agile methodology was utilized with throughout the project.

<h2> Challenges </h2>

  &nbsp; Due to our tight time constraints, a design sprint was used for our team workflow. A couple
  challenges I experienced in this project was the merging complications with Git and the adequate ability to communicate front end design work with
  the back end developers of our team. After much trial and error, I began to get more comfortable and am more knowledgeable of solving merge
  conflicts. Additonally, because I was new to learning back end code, I recognized the usage of UML diagrams and back end language fluency as a better way to communciate
  more effecively as we worked together on completing features of this application.


<h2> My Role </h2>
    &nbsp; Other than general group tasks, I specifically created wireframes for the project, implemented jQuery functionality, styling in CSS,
    coding the logic of icongraphy labels in Ruby and seeding the database with postgreSQL.
