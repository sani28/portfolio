<h2> Joyful Mobile Experience </h2>

  <p>

  &nbsp; Joyful is a mobile application that aims to mend potential relationship gaps between the parent and their adult children. By giving the users another way to better convey and share their feelings, Joyful is designed for the opportunity to rebuild or strengthen our bonds with each other.


<p>
<h2> Challenge </h2>


  <p>

    &nbsp;   The ideation of this mobile application came about the desire to solve communication gaps between parents and their adult children. Our team was passionate about finding a way to bring healthy relationship to the forefront of our experiences in a way that that was delightful and undisruptive to our userâ€™s lifestyle. Because of the naturally occurring circumstances that cause children to grow farther apart from their parents as they age, our domain was chosen to consist of independent adult children and parents who seek to solve past conflicts and maintain a healthy relationship with one another. Staging the user experience flow for our application was iterated to an experience map and journey flow map as follows:

    </p>


<button id="myBtn"> Experience + Journey Map  </button>

<div id="myModal" class="modal">

  <div class="modal-content">
    <span class="close">&times;</span>

  </div>
</div>



<h2> Challenges  </h2>

     <p>&nbsp; The results of our user case studies suggested that our audience use mulitple social messaging applications and that they preferred to use ones they are already familiar with.
       Therefore to best suit our users needs, we needed to surround our application around the idea of sharing letters through different sns platforms. While working with this constraint,
       we also wanted to distinguish our app from other photo/message sharing apps by dedicating the app's experience primrarily for relationship building in a delightful manner. With a lot of
       competing ideas, we had to narrow our scope into two primary features that we thought would best suit this goal. We overcame this challenge best by the process of rapid
       prototyping & user testing. Through this process, we were able to immedietly grasp some gaps between our ideas and functionality, while also discovering UI problems along the way and
       solving them in a timely manner thanks to the implentation of our prototypes using Sketch and Flinto.
       </p>


<h2> Solution </h2>

    <p> &nbsp; We proposed 2 primary features that embodied what we believed to be delightful and immersive: audiophotography notes and digtal letters. By combining audio and imagery in one, we hoped to invoke sentimtal
     experience that is both memorable and meaningful. Our digital letter feature making was another immersive touchpoint in which we designed it to be customizable through colors, texts and emojis that help our users best express themsleves.
     Additoinally, for guidance of use we created an onboarding experience by using videos and walk-through text that allowed our users to learn what this app was intended for. Our design decisions around our style guide was based on the feelings of joy and vibrant feelings.  </p>



<h2> My Role </h2>

    <p> &nbsp; In this project I did interaction design in Flinto, wireframing in Sketch, animation in Adobe After Effects and visual graphics
    in Adobe Illustrator.  </p>
